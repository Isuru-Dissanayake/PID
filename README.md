# PID

### Approach 

This is a small attempt to write a arduino based PID program for a to solve a line maze using a robot. This project can be sub divided as follows,

1. Selecting proper hardware components
2. Desinging the robot using a computer aided software 
3. Assembling the robot 
4. Programming the robot to complete the task

note : program will depend on the hardware you selected
