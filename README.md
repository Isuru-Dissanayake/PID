# PID

### Approach 

This is a small attempt to write a arduino based PID program for a to solve a line maze using a robot. This project can be sub divided as follows,

1. Selecting proper hardware components
2. Desinging the robot using a computer aided software 
3. Assembling the robot 
4. Programming the robot to complete the task

note : program will depend on the hardware you selected

### PID arduino code explained

8 Ir sensors are used here to identify the white line in the black background. These IR inputs are taken as analog inputs and then they are converted in to digital values by using an analog to digital conversion function.
